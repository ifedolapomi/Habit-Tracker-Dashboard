Client Request: Habit Tracker Dashboard (Excel/Google Sheets)

## Project Title: Build a Custom Habit Tracker With Dashboard & Automated Insights

Project Description:
### Client Request: 
Hello, my name is dray, am looking for someone to create a simple but professional Habit Tracking system for personal productivity. I want the tracker built in Excel or Google Sheets (whichever works best).
The purpose is to track my daily habits easily and get **weekly/monthly insights** about my performance.



# **✔ Project Requirements**

### **1. Habit Tracking Sheet**

* A daily table where I can mark habits as completed or not completed
* I want to track **5–10 habits**
* Checkboxes or “✔ / ✘” format is fine
* Should automatically calculate:

  * Daily total
  * Weekly total
  * Monthly total

---

### **2. Metrics & Calculations**

The tracker should automatically show:

* Habit completion percentage
* Best-performing habit
* Worst-performing habit
* Total habits completed per week
* Monthly performance summary

### **4. Design Requirements**
* Clean, simple, and beginner-friendly
* Color-coded indicators (green = completed, red = missed)
* Easy for me to modify habits later
* Should work on both desktop and mobile (Google Sheets recommended)

### **5. Deliverables**

* The final Excel/Google Sheets file
* Short documentation on how to use it
* A link or screenshots of the dashboard



# **✔ Additional Notes**

* I don't want anything too complex — just something functional and visually appealing
* Please ensure formulas are clear and not too advanced so I can edit them later
* Creativity is welcomed if you can add small improvements
